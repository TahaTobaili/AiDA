# AiDA: Your Genius Math Assistant

Welcome to AiDA, your next-generation AI-powered Math Assistant designed to enhance your mathematical understanding and problem-solving skills. Built with a mix of cutting-edge technologies including Streamlit, LangChain, OpenAI, and various community integrations, AiDA offers a unique conversational experience for exploring mathematical concepts through interactive dialogue and visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive AI Conversations**: Engage with AiDA in a conversational manner to explore mathematical concepts, receive guidance on problems, and much more.
- **Dynamic Content Retrieval**: AiDA intelligently retrieves relevant information from a variety of sources, including webpages and YouTube, to provide context-rich explanations.
- **Mermaid Chart Visualization**: Utilize the power of mermaid.js integrated within AiDA to visualize complex workflows and mathematical concepts through dynamically generated flowcharts.
- **Text-to-Speech Responses**: Experience AiDA's responses not just in text, but also through voice, enhancing the interactive learning process.
- **Vectorized Document Storage**: Documents and video transcripts are chunked, vectorized, and stored efficiently for quick retrieval using OpenAI embeddings and Chroma.

## Installation
